# Autor
My comfortable way to write and run TS scripts.

This is a very simple package, mainly used for me to write automation scripts myself. If you already know Node and TS, you can use this package by clone the [template](https://github.com/zarmot/autor-workspace), open in vscode, and press F5 to run current editing script.
